    "Title": "SmilesPE: tokenizer algorithm for SMILES, DeepSMILES, and SELFIES",
    "Description": "The Smiles Pair Encoding method generates smiles substring tokens based on high-frequency token pairs from large chemical datasets. This method is well-suited for both QSAR activities as well as generative models. The model provided here has been pretrained using ChEMBL.",
    "Mode": "Pretrained",

    "Output": ["Text"],
    "Output Type": ["String"],
    "Output Shape": "Single",
    "Interpretation": "The pretrained model is trained on a a list of SMILES based on its source code. Also, the main dataset is augmented, which means that the final data set is ~2 times larger than the original one. The number of SPE symbols during training was 30,000",
